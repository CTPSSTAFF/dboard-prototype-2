				<h4>Performance-based Planning and Programming</h4>
				<p>The MPO uses a performance-based planning and programming (PBPP) process to assess how its spending decisions support progress toward this vision. 
				   PBPP processes include three phases:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Establish the goals and objectives, performance measures, and targets that will guide MPO decision-making, and identify and acquire necessary data. 
					</li>
					<li>Use the framework established in the planning phase to create a strategy for investing MPO funds. 
					</li>
					<li>Review and report on the outcomes of MPO investment decisions with respect to performance measures and targets, 
					    and determine what framework or strategy adjustments are needed. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>PBPP activities help the MPO make informed decisions in accountable, transparent ways. PBPP shapes the MPO’s Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) and 
				   Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). PBPP is also integrated into the MPO’s decision-making on planning emphasis areas and studies conducted via 
				   the Unified Planning Work Program. 
				   Data and analyses from the Congestion Management Process support the PBPP process.
				</p>
				<p>Please refer to Boston Region MPO Performance-based Planning and Programming (PDF) Boston Region MPO Performance-based Planning and Programming(HTML) for 
				   additional information about PBPP concepts, related federal requirements, and the MPO’s PBPP process.
				</p>
				<p>For the MPO’s most recent LRTP systems performance report, which describes the MPO’s baseline values and targets for its performance measures, 
				   see the Systems Performance Report chapter (PDF) Systems Performance Report chapter(HTML) of the Destination 2050 plan. For a performance analysis
				   of the MPO’s current TIP, which describes the MPO’s performance targets and how projects in the TIP may improve performance, see 
				   the Performance Analysis chapter (PDF) Performance Analysis chapter(HTML) in the federal fiscal years 2024–28 TIP.
				</p>

				<h4>Recent Activities and MPO Actions</h4>
				<p>The US Department of Transportation requires states, MPOs, and operators of public transportation to establish targets for performance measures in key areas. 
				   The MPO will set targets on an ongoing basis for specific federally required performance measures, and it will coordinate on PBPP activities with the 
				   Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and other regional transit authorities, and other MPOs 
				   and stakeholders. The MPO has recently adopted the following sets of performance targets to meet federal requirements and create an effective, 
				   integrated, and informative PBPP process.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Transit Safety Targets</li>
					<li>Transit Asset Management (TAM) Targets</li>
					<li>National Highway System Bridge and Pavement Condition</sli>
					<li>Roadway Safety Targets/<li>
					<li>Travel Time Reliability Targets</li>
					<li>Congestion Reduction and Air Quality Targets</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Past Targets and Performance</h4>
				<p>For information on other target-setting efforts from previous years, visit the PBPP Archive page.
				</p>
				<h4>Stay Informed</h4>
				<p>The MPO welcomes your feedback on the PBPP process, including the selection of measures, targets, 
				   nd projects to improve the transportation system’s performance.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>View the MPO’s meeting calendar to find opportunities to listen to MPO discussions and provide feedback in person.
					</li>
					<li>Share your comments online through any of the MPO’s public involvement channels.

				<h3>Roadway Safety</h3>
				<p>On February 3, 2023, the MPO board voted to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ calendar year (CY) 2023 targets for a set of 
				   federally required roadway safety performance measures. 
				   The Commonwealth and MPOs are required to establish one-year targets for these measures on an annual basis, 
				   which pertain to fatalities and serious injuries occurring on roadways. By adopting these targets, the MPO agrees to plan and program 
				   projects that help the Commonwealth achieve its roadway safety targets. For more information about these measures, CY 2023 targets, 
				   and related processes, please refer to the memorandum titled Roadway Safety Targets, Calendar Year 2023 (PDF) Roadway Safety Targets, 
				   Calendar Year 2023 (HTML).

			    <h3>Transit Safety</h3>
				<p>On March 16, 2023, the MPO board voted to adopt updated transit safety performance targets based on targets set by the MBTA, 
				   the Cape Ann Transportation Authority (CATA), and the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA). 
				   These targets pertain to (1) the number and rate of fatalities; (2) the number and rate of injuries; (3) the number and rate of 
				   safety events; and (4) system reliability, which is measured in vehicle-revenue miles per major mechanical failure. 
				   These targets are set by mode and reflect either calendar year (CY) 2023 or state fiscal year (SFY) 2023, depending on the agency. 
				   For more information about transit safety performance requirements and these targets, please refer to the memorandum titled:

				<h3>Transit Asset Management</h3>
				<p>On March 9, 2023, the MPO board voted to establish an updated set of TAM performance targets. 
				   Transit agencies and MPOs are required to set targets related to the state of good repair of passenger and service vehicles, 
				   facilities, and fixed-guideway infrastructure. The MPO’s TAM performance targets draw directly from targets set by the MBTA, CATA, 
				   and MWRTA and apply to State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2023 (July 2022 through June 2023). 
				   For more information about TAM activities, performance measures, and targets, please refer to the memorandum titled:

				<h3>Bridge and Pavement Conditon</h3>
				<p>On February 16, 2023, the MPO board voted to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ two-year and four-year performance targets related 
				   to National Highway System bridge and pavement condition and travel time reliability on the Interstate Highway System and non-Interstate 
				   National Highway System. For more information about these targets, see the following materials:

				<h3>Travel Time Reliability</h3>
				<p>On January 5, 2023, the MPO board voted to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ two-year and four-year performance targets related to
